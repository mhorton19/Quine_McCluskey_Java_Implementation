# Quine_McCluskey_Java_Implementation
This is an implementation of the Quine_McCluskey algorthim which reduces sequential logic circuits (inputted as either a sum of products or product of sums) to its minimal form. This algorithm has the same purpose as karnaugh mapping, but it can be proven to be optimal and it can simplify a set of multiple functions sharing the same inputs.  This algorithm's run time scales very poorly, but the most time intensive parts could be done in parallel, so in the future I would like to utilize a GPU and program in a faster language such as C to speed this up and make it a viable way to simplify larger circuits.
